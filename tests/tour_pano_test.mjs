   Deriving the export list mechanically fixes the two ways the old

   not see, and an export nobody destructured). It does not fix a helper
   being added to the fence and then never checked by anything at all — that
   gap produces no import-time error, so it gets its own check: every
   FUNCTION the derivation found must appear, as a whole word, somewhere in
   the checks above.

   Functions only, deliberately. The first version of this demanded a mention
   of every top-level name, which swept in three dozen private tuning
   constants — SUN_MIN_ALT, VEHICLE_MIN_LUM, DECLUTTER_GAP and the like. The
   only way to satisfy that is to write `check(SUN_MIN_ALT === 7)`, a check
   that asserts a constant equals itself, passes forever, and fails the moment
   somebody tunes the one number it exists to let them tune. A gate that can
   only be satisfied by writing worthless checks trains people to write
   worthless checks, so it covers behaviour — functions — and the constants
   are covered where they actually bite, inside the functions that read them.

   INDIRECT is the deliberate escape hatch, and it is deliberately noisy to
   use. These are internal steps of a parser whose behaviour is asserted
   through its public entry point: the EXIF chunk walkers are exercised by
   every readGps check against a real JPEG, PNG and WebP buffer. A new helper
   is not allowed to join this list by accident — the check fails until
   somebody either writes it a check or writes its name here on purpose, and
   the second one is a decision with a reviewer's name on it. */
